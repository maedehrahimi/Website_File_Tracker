# Website_File_Tracker
The Website File Tracker is a Python script designed to monitor and track files (such as images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) referenced on specified websites. It collects data on each file's URL, HTTP status code, and load time, storing this information in an SQLite database (website_data.db).
